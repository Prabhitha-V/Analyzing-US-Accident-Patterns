# 📊 Analyzing US Accident Patterns through Advanced Visual Analytics

This project analyzes U.S. accident data using rich, interactive visualizations to uncover patterns related to accident severity, location, weather, infrastructure, and time. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can guide public safety improvements, urban planning, and emergency response strategies.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 📍 **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualizes high-risk areas with choropleths and accident heatmaps.
- 🕒 **Temporal Analysis**: Examines accident trends by hour, day, season, and year.
- ☁️ **Environmental Factors**: Studies the impact of weather, visibility, and lighting on accidents.
- 🛣️ **Infrastructure Gaps**: Identifies hazardous road features (junctions, signals, etc.) linked to severity.
- 💬 **Sentiment Analysis**: Explores language and emotion in accident descriptions to capture public perspective.
